provide a web interface to program the Science of Cambridge's MK14 from a raspberry pi

It is built upon the work of others to provide an interface to the Sciend of Cambridge's MK14 keyboard from the Raspberry pi.

The original interface used a python script on the Pi and ran through the SSH interface.
